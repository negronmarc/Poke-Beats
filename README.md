## General-info

The goal of this project is to use the pokeAPI so we can access information about the pokemon that we have in the dropdown box on our homepage. After choosing your pokemon it will display the pokemon and a song related to them. You can view other pokemon not in our dropdown by clicking on the Pokedex tab on the top. We also added a link to the pokemon main page by clicking on the pokemon logo and a link to our contact information in the contact tab.
